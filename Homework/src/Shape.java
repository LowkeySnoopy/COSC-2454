// Shape Interface â€“ Part A

/*
This Java program demonstrates the use of interfaces in object-oriented programming.
An interface named Shape is defined with a method area(). Two classes, Circle and Rectangle,
implement this interface and provide their own logic to calculate area.
The program tests polymorphism by passing Circle and Rectangle objects to a method
that prints their respective areas using the Shape interface.

public interface Shape {
    public double area();
